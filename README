Calculon is an automated testing program for compiling, running, and evaluating the performance of 
programs according to a supplied Test Suite file and accompanying input and output files. Calculon
uses the supplied SafeRun executable to contain any misbehaving programs and limit their runtime
and process tree.

Here is an example *.suite file:
P a.out main.c header.h
T test1.in test1.out 1000 -a -b -c
T test2.in test2.out 1000 -xyz
T test3.in test3.out 800
P b.out bprogram.c SmartAlloc.c SmartAlloc.h
T test5.in test5.out 10000
T test4.in test4.out 30000 -verbose

The P flag indicates the program name and files required to compile the tested program
The following T flags list the details of each test including supplied input, required output,
runtime limit, and program flags

To compile:

$ gcc Calculon.c List.c List.h -o Calculon

To run, put all required files into Calculon's directory, then:

$ ./Calculon <suitename>.suite

and Calculon will create a temp directory, copy all required file to that directory, run the
requried tests, then delete all temp files and prints the number of tests passed or the
details of failed tests.
